We have shown the difference between a granularity of $\\Delta$ t = 0.25 s and $\\Delta$ t = 60 s. We arrived at a choice for $\\Delta$ t = 0.25 s for our case, but let us think a bit more general: think of four criteria that play a role in deciding on the granularity for the measurements of a dataset."
